# Open-F1-Analysis

The main goal of this project is to be able to predict (somewhat reliably) the results of competitive sessions in an F1 weekend based on the results of the practice sessions. Secondary goals include providing descriptive statistics for things like teammate comparisons and team performance trajectories to remove bias from F1 conversations and fantasy team choices.
